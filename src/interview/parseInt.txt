The `parseInt` function is used to convert a string into an integer (whole number) in JavaScript.
 In the provided code, it's used to ensure that the value entered in the input field is treated
  as an integer when comparing it to the age conditions (greater than, less than, or equal to 18).

Here's why `parseInt` is used:

1. **User Input as String**: When a user enters their age into an input field,
 it's received as a string by default. For example, if the user enters "18" in the input field,
  it's treated as the string `"18"`, not the number `18`.

2. **Comparison**: In order to compare the entered age with the conditions (`> 18`, `< 18`, `=== 18`),
 it's necessary to convert the string into an integer. If you don't convert it,
  JavaScript will perform string comparison, which may not give the correct results for
   numerical comparisons.

By using `parseInt`, you convert the string representation of the age into an actual integer,
 ensuring that the numerical conditions work as expected. For instance, `parseInt("18")`
  returns the integer `18`, which can be correctly compared with the conditions.
